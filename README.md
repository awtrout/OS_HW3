# Memory Management: Logical to Physical Address Translation

## Program Functionality:
This C program demonstrates memory management concepts by implementing translation of logical addresses to physical addresses using a page/frame table. The program defines a page/frame table data structure to map logical page numbers to physical frame numbers. It provides functions to initialize the page/frame table, map logical pages to physical frames, and translate logical addresses to physical addresses. If a required page is not present in memory (i.e., a page fault occurs), the program handles it appropriately.

## Instructions for Execution:
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC.
2. Save the provided C code into a file, e.g., `memory_management.c`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the C file.
4. Compile the C code using the following command: gcc memory_management.c -o memory_management
This will generate an executable file named `memory_management`.
5. Run the compiled program using the following command: ./memory_management
6. You should see the output displaying the translation of logical addresses to physical addresses, along with page numbers and offsets.

## Sample Output:
Logical Address: 0x3A7F => Page Number: 0x0D, Offset: 0x7F => Physical Address: 0x1F7F
Logical Address: 0xABCD => Page Number: 0x2B, Offset: 0xCD => Physical Address: 0x4ECD
Logical Address: 0x5678 => Page Number: 0x15, Offset: 0x78 => Physical Address: 0x7A78

## Notes:
- The provided sample logical addresses and mappings in the code are for demonstration purposes. Modify them as needed for your specific use case.
- This program assumes a simple direct mapping between logical pages and physical frames. More sophisticated memory management schemes can be implemented by extending the code.
